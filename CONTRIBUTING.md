**Contributions are more than welcome**

* If you would like to contribute, please fork the repository, create a branch and submit a pull request.
* If you can't code but have a feature you want, please submit an issue and I'll add it as a feature request.
* If you find a bug, please report it as an issue with a description of how to replicate.

## Code Quality

If you are submitting pull requests, please at least roughly follow the layout so things are internally consistent. Otherwise I'm not that particular about the formatting as long a it compiles. If it's super messy though I may ask you to clean it up a little before accepting.

## Important Note

_**Be Kind**_

I'm not a full time Swift developer and the code or layout or whatever may be messy, or may not be. There may be better ways to do some of the things that Dialog does. If you know a better way then that's awesome, please let me know either as a pull request or issue.
