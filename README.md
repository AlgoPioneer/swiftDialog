# Dialog

Dialog is an [open source](https://github.com/bartreardon/Dialog-public/blob/main/LICENSE.md) admin utility app for macOS 11+ written in SwiftUI that displays a popup dialog, displaying the content to your users that you want to display.

Dialog's purpose is as a tool for Mac Admins to show informative messages via scripts, and relay back the users actions.

The latest version can be found on the [Releases](https://github.com/bartreardon/Dialog-public/releases) page

Detailed documentation and information can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/bartreardon/Dialog-public/wiki)

# Main Features

## Appearance
Every aspect of Dialog's appearance can be modified.

At the most simple level you need only give Dialog a [Title](https://github.com/bartreardon/Dialog-public/wiki/Customising-the-Title) and a [Message](https://github.com/bartreardon/Dialog-public/wiki/Customising-the-Message-area) to display but there is more utility in modifying other aspects of the appearance:
 * [Pass in an image resource](https://github.com/bartreardon/Dialog-public/wiki/Customising-the-Icon) to display as the dialog icon, or use an app path or system preference bundle path and dialog will extract the icon for display.
 * [Add extra buttons](https://github.com/bartreardon/Dialog-public/wiki/Buttons-and-button-behaviour). Change the text to say what you want. Wait for user input or autimatically time out.
 * [Use markdown](https://github.com/bartreardon/Dialog-public/wiki/Customising-the-Message-area#markdown-support-new-from-v150) in the message dialog to add **bold** or _italics_ or include URL links
 * Change the [colour, size or even the font](https://github.com/bartreardon/Dialog-public/wiki/Customising-the-Title#customising-title-font-properties) used in the Title and Message areas
 * [Change the size](https://github.com/bartreardon/Dialog-public/wiki/Window-Size-and-Behaviour) of the dialog window
 * Display [Videos](https://github.com/bartreardon/Dialog-public/wiki/Customising-the-Message-area#displaying-videos-new-from-v180) or [Images](https://github.com/bartreardon/Dialog-public/wiki/Customising-the-Message-area#displaying-images-new-from-v160) either locally or pass in a URL
 * and lots more...


## Commandline Options

Dialog's interface is fully customised from a set of command line options.

For details on all the available options, please read the [Command Line Options](https://github.com/bartreardon/Dialog-public/wiki/Command-Line-Options) page on the wiki.


## Getting Feedback
Feedback on how someone interacts with dialog can passed back into the calling script. At a basic level dialog's exit codes will represent what button was pressed. For user input, dialog will output any data to `sdtout` in either plain text or optionally json format for easy parsing.
