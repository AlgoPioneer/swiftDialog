# swiftDialog

swiftDialog is an [open source](https://github.com/bartreardon/Dialog/blob/main/LICENSE.md) admin utility for macOS 12 or later written in SwiftUI that presents custom dialogs, displays informative messages or can be used as a form to request user input.

Detailed documentation and information can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/bartreardon/Dialog/wiki)

## Appearance
Every aspect of swiftDialog's appearance can be modified.

At the most simple level you need only give swiftDialog a [Title](https://github.com/bartreardon/Dialog/wiki/Customising-the-Title) and a [Message](https://github.com/bartreardon/Dialog/wiki/Customising-the-Message-area) to display but there is more utility in modifying other aspects of the appearance:
 * [Pass in an image resource](https://github.com/bartreardon/Dialog/wiki/Customising-the-Icon) to display as the swiftDialog icon, or use an app path or system preference bundle path and swiftDialog will extract the icon for display.
 * [Add extra buttons](https://github.com/bartreardon/Dialog/wiki/Buttons-and-button-behaviour). Change the text to say what you want. Wait for user input or autimatically time out.
 * [Use markdown](https://github.com/bartreardon/Dialog/wiki/Customising-the-Message-area#markdown-support-new-from-v150) in the message to add **bold** or _italics_ or include URL links
 * Change the [colour, size or even the font](https://github.com/bartreardon/Dialog/wiki/Customising-the-Title#customising-title-font-properties) used in the Title and Message areas
 * [Change the size](https://github.com/bartreardon/Dialog/wiki/Window-Size-and-Behaviour) of the swiftDialog window
 * Display [Videos](https://github.com/bartreardon/Dialog/wiki/Customising-the-Message-area#displaying-videos-new-from-v180) or [Images](https://github.com/bartreardon/Dialog/wiki/Customising-the-Message-area#displaying-images-new-from-v160) either locally or pass in a URL
 * and lots more...

swiftDialog's interface is fully customised from a set of command line options.
